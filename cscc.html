              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▹ Distributed Stress Testing: It is about distributing stress on several devices that
                may be in different geographical areas, and testing them at the same time to examine their endurance
                capacity.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▹ Exploratory Stress Testing: It is a test that focuses on detecting and analyzing
                errors in technical components after testing and analyzing them in different scenarios, which cannot be
                easily covered in the scope of other tests.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▹ Application Stress Testing: It is a test that focuses on detecting
                application-related errors, related to performance, network issues, and data blocking.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▹ Systemic Stress Testing: It tests many systems running on the server, to detect
                errors (e.g.: One program blocking another program).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▹ Transactional Stress Testing: It is a stress test that is conducted during the
                transitioning between applications, to ensure that the system is tuned and optimized.</p>
